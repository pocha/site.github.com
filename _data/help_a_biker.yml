    content: Motokarta is equivalent of iOverlander but much more popular in Russia / Soviet region. Unlike iOverlander, it also shows traveling motorbikers & in case of emergency, you may probably find someone nearby & possibly can summon him/her. For reaching out, whatsapp messaging is recommended after you have found the person's number from the website, especially if you can not speak Russian.
