    content: Oleg (road name Pereiro .. apparently in Russia, there is tradition of every biker having a road name), owner of the Bike Point, is probably the most connected guys among bikers in Soviet Union. He has friends pretty much everywhere in Soviet region. Bike Point is a hostel like setup for traveling motorbikers in Soviet Union & you pay as you like. Oleg can understand & speak a bit of English, but best to converse with him on whatsapp in Russian using Google Translate

    tags: russia, kazakhstan, tajikistan, kyrgyzstan
    content: Motokarta is equivalent of iOverlander but much more popular in Russia / Soviet region. Unlike iOverlander, it also shows traveling motorbikers & in case of emergency, you may probably find someone nearby & possibly can summon him/her. For reaching out, whatsapp messaging is recommended after you have found the person's number from the website, especially if you can not speak Russian.
