I quit my job in Oct 2020 thinking I would do a startup. But I wanted to take a bit of time & travel too. I got through Facebook London & then I ditched my startup plan to join Facebook (pretty lame but guess that was the reality). I wanted to do a ride from Bangalore, India to London but I got frustrated when Covid forced countries to shut their land borders. That is when I decided to do a pan India solo motorbike trip.

        <img src="/images/pan-india-with-bike-friends.jpeg" style="width:50%; display:inline; float:left" /> 
</div>
<div style="width:100%;clear:both; text-align:center; font-size:x-small; margin-bottom: 5em">
        <span style="width:50%; display:inline; float:left">I with bike fully loaded just before leaving</span>
        <span style="width:50%; display:inline; float:left">Friends & wife in the picture seeing me off at a nearby cafe</span> 
</div>

Unfortunately I could only do it half as India was hit by 2nd Covid wave in April 2021. I was on the road for 44 days & wrote 1 post for my experience of the day. Below is the list of the blogs. All my blogs are on substack.com & clicking on any of them will take you to pocha.substack.com.
