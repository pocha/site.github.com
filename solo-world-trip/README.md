Back in 2021, when I had to relocate to UK, I wanted to drive a car from Bangalore, India to London. But due to covid forcing the land borders closure, I ended up doing a solo ride India. But the thought had been planted since then. Fast forward to 2023, when I had to come to India, I decided to fulfill the dream.

As for the path, I wanted to ride through Fjords in Norway. I had attempted this before but had an accident close to London & then had to shelve my plan ([details in this post](https://pocha.substack.com/p/uk-ireland-motorbike-trip-part-2)). I had earlier planned to enter France from UK & then ride south around coastal area of Portugal, Spain, south of France but then during the quick trip to India, I thought, maybe I should complete the pending ride through Norway & changed my plan.

<p style="font-size: x-small;padding-bottom: 1em">London to Kyrigistan path that I originally planned to take via Scandanavia, Georgia, Russia, Kazakhistan. Google map does not show route in China so could not map it all the way to India. Its 10k miles (15k kms) till Kyrgistan but should reach 20k mark till India. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/London,+United+Kingdom/Leuven,+Belgium/Bergen,+Norway/Trondheim,+Norway/Stockholm,+Sweden/Tallinn,+Estonia/Warsaw,+Poland/Prague,+Czechia/Munich,+Germany/Pyrenees/Sofia,+Bulgaria/%C4%B0stanbul,+T%C3%BCrkiye/Tbilisi,+Georgia/Atyrau,+Kazakhstan/Derweze,+Turkmenistan/Irkeshtam,+Kyrgyzstan/@50.1277864,16.6776109,5.6z/data=!4m97!4m96!1m5!1m1!1s0x47d8a00baf21de75:0x52963a5addd52a99!2m2!1d-0.1275862!2d51.5072178!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c160d05ebbdf85:0x40099ab2f4d5690!2m2!1d4.7137645!2d50.8822871!1m5!1m1!1s0x46390d4966767d77:0x9e42a03eb4de0a08!2m2!1d5.3220544!2d60.3912628!1m5!1m1!1s0x466d319747037e53:0xbf7c8288f3cf3d4!2m2!1d10.3950528!2d63.4305149!1m5!1m1!1s0x465f763119640bcb:0xa80d27d3679d7766!2m2!1d18.0685808!2d59.3293235!1m5!1m1!1s0x46929499df5616bf:0x400b36d18fc6270!2m2!1d24.7535747!2d59.4369608!1m5!1m1!1s0x471ecc669a869f01:0x72f0be2a88ead3fc!2m2!1d21.0122287!2d52.2296756!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b939c0970798b:0x400af0f66164090!2m2!1d14.4378005!2d50.0755381!1m5!1m1!1s0x479e75f9a38c5fd9:0x10cb84a7db1987d!2m2!1d11.5819805!2d48.1351253!1m5!1m1!1s0x12a8a48b202023d5:0x1711d86785a522d6!2m2!1d1.0011899!2d42.6681804!1m5!1m1!1s0x40aa8682cb317bf5:0x400a01269bf5e60!2m2!1d23.3218675!2d42.6977082!1m5!1m1!1s0x14cab6515a60157b:0x22ac9af4915a1de8!2m2!1d28.7664408!2d41.1634302!1m5!1m1!1s0x40440cd7e64f626b:0x61d084ede2576ea3!2m2!1d44.8015168!2d41.6938026!1m5!1m1!1s0x41a3ea26f5b2dd0d:0x3e4a125c0e268d2d!2m2!1d51.9238373!2d47.0944959!1m5!1m1!1s0x3f62b4f7b4d79731:0x1b7a8833c89ceca!2m2!1d58.4169385!2d40.1739571!1m5!1m1!1s0x3895bcb939b6b20d:0x4cdabe973796a287!2m2!1d73.8985042!2d39.6783413" target="_blank">Google Map link of the path in detail</a></p>

At the time of writing this post, I ended up chaging the path quite a bit. The notable detour is avoiding west Kazakhstan in favour of Russia, primarily to avoid the heat. I was scared that if I broke down in 40+ deg heat, it may become fatal for me.

<p style="font-size: x-small;padding-bottom: 1em; text-align:center">The actual path I took. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=1-k3z-DldosdzkuayqEkLbTK5lWG4-Tw&ll=43.03320326285542%2C34.30586065368651&z=4" target="_blank">Complete map link</a></p>

As visible from the path, I have not completed the ride. My bike is parked at Almaty, Kazakhstan & I have come to India (more details on my [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwvgMOjK0z1/)). As of now, my plan is to go back next summers & complete the ride.

As usual, on the road, I wrote blog post of my experience. I got a lot of help from unknown people including some police guys in Kazakhstan giving me money :). I had done very little preparation & planning for the trip. Spent like a week buying a cheap motorcycle & another week, getting all the accessories. Not to mention, I got my Schengen visa first. But then all other visas I figured on the way. All the details are covered in the blog posts below. I had lost (actually forgotten) my waist pouch in Kazakhstan & I have not written post after that. So there should be more posts that would follow.
