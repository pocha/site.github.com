During my [solo London to India motorcycle trip](/solo-world-trip), I got a lot of help from various motorbikers. Usually, the modus operandi went like this - some motorbiker whom I had found from [Bunk A Biker](https://www.zeemaps.com/bunk-a-biker_world), knew local motorcycle club & asked for help in the group on my behalf & voila, my problem used to be solved :). While on the road, I figured that finding these groups by myself was hard. So I decided to create a listing of such resources.
